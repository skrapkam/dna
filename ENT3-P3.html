						<p ><b ><span >III. Searching for the Y chromosome of China&#39;s Prime Minister Cao <span class="SpellE">Cao</span></span></b></p>

						<p ><b ><span >&nbsp;</span></b></p>

						<p ><span >Cao <span class="SpellE">Cao</span> (AD 155-220) was a famous historical figure in <st1:country-region ><st1:place >China</st1:place></st1:country-region>. He was the prime minister during China&lsquo;s eastern Han dynasty. His son became the emperor of the next Wei dynasty. Some people say that Cao <span class="SpellE">Cao</span> was very cunning and other say that he was extremely wise. Indeed, he was a controversial historical figure in Chinese history.</span></p>

						<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p ><span class="hps"><b ><span >1. An unavoidable issue at <st1:placename ><span class="SpellE">Fudan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype >University</st1:placetype> in <st1:city ><st1:place >Shanghai</st1:place></st1:city></span></b></span></p>

						<p ><span class="hps"><b ><span >&nbsp;</span></b></span></p>

						<p ><span class="hps"><span >Towards the end of 2009, an announcement from <st1:placename >Anyang</st1:placename> <st1:placetype >City</st1:placetype> in <st1:place ><st1:placename >Henan</st1:placename> <st1:placetype >Province</st1:placetype></st1:place> concerning the discovery of Cao <span class="SpellE">Cao&#39;s</span> tomb was made. Among the 3 unearthed <span class="GramE">skeleton</span> there was a male whose age was determined to be around 60 years old. Archeologist from <st1:place ><st1:placename >Henan</st1:placename> <st1:placetype >Province</st1:placetype></st1:place> claimed that this was the body of Cao <span class="SpellE">Cao</span>. Once this news was released, it aroused much heated debates and a great deal of interest in <st1:country-region ><st1:place >China</st1:place></st1:country-region>. There were many skeptics among them. About 10 years prior to this announcement, molecular anthropologists at <st1:placename ><span class="SpellE">Fudan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype >University</st1:placetype> had published many articles concerning the origin of the Chinese people as well as the Y chromosome </span></span><span class="hps"><span lang="EN" >haplogroups </span></span><span class="hps"><span >in <st1:country-region ><st1:place >China</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Some of these publications were awarded the national technology awards. At the same time, their Y chromosome testing had <span class="GramE">help</span> ordinary people confirm his/her paternal genealogy for a number of years. For this testing, the cost varies from being free of charge to $900 <span class="GramE">RMB .</span> The result of the testing had benefited many interested individuals. </span></span></p>

						<p ><span class="hps"><span >&nbsp;</span></span></p>

						<p ><span class="hps"><span >Once the authenticity of Cao <span class="SpellE">Cao&#39;s</span> skeleton was questioned, it was natural for people to suggest. It is time for <st1:place ><st1:placename ><span class="SpellE">Fudan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype >University&#39;</st1:placetype></st1:place>s molecular anthropologists to perform some testing.<span >&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For this reason, to confirm the authenticity of Cao <span class="SpellE">Cao&#39;s</span> skeleton became an unavoidable issue for <st1:place ><st1:placename ><span class="SpellE">Fudan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype >University</st1:placetype></st1:place>. <st1:placename ><span class="SpellE">Fudan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype >University</st1:placetype> and CAS Shanghai Institute for Biological Sciences, <st1:place ><st1:placetype >Institute</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename >Computational Biology</st1:placename></st1:place></span></span><strong><span >undertook</span></strong> <span class="hps"><span >this task.</span></span></p>

						<p ><span class="hps">&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p ><b ><span >2. Where do we begin?</span></b></p>

						<p ><b ><span >&nbsp;</span></b></p>

						<p ><span >Just as the aforementioned case with <st1:place >Jefferson</st1:place>, once Cao <span class="SpellE">Cao&#39;s</span> descendants are found, then one can find Cao <span class="SpellE">Cao&#39;s</span> Y chromosome. There were approximately seven million people in <st1:country-region ><st1:place >China</st1:place></st1:country-region> with the surname Cao. Who are the descendants of Cao <span class="SpellE">Cao</span> who lived 1800 years ago? Obviously, the only way is to first the books of <span class="SpellE">Cao&#39;s</span> Genealogy. The researchers found a total of 118 books of <span class="SpellE">Cao&#39;s</span> Genealogy in Shanghai Library which enabled the researchers to find Cao <span class="SpellE">Cao&#39;s</span> descendants through these documents.</span></p>

						<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p ><span class="hps"><b ><span >3. The Research Results </span></b></span></p>

						<p ><span class="hps"><span >&nbsp;</span></span></p>

						<p ><span >The laboratory at <st1:place ><st1:placename ><span class="SpellE">Fudan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype >University</st1:placetype></st1:place> started the Y chromosome sequencing of all these blood samples. <span class="GramE">From six tribe who claimed to be Cao <span class="SpellE">Cao&#39;s</span> descendants,</span> their Y chromosome had the M268 genetic marker belonging to the O2 haplogroup according to the international gene organization&#39;s paternal genealogy map. The divergent point of the ancestors of this chromosome occurred approximately 1800 to 2000 years ago. This time point coincided with the period when Cao <span class="SpellE">Cao</span> lived. </span></p>

						<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p ><span >In these families were distributed in various part of the country and&nbsp;if all these family tree documents were fake, it would be such an incredible coincidence that they have the same haplogroup but came from different origins. The probability of these two events occurring simultaneously is the product of the probability of these two events occurring independently. Therefore, the probability is 5% if these two families have the same M268-O2 Y chromosome haplogroup. The probability of having the same <span class="SpellE">Cao&rsquo;s</span> genetic <span class="SpellE">haplogroup</span> in six individuals living in different parts of the country is (0.05)</span><span ><sup><span >5</span></sup><span >. The product is three in 10,000,000. This means that the possibility of fraud is 3/10,000,000. From the viewpoint of forensic science, one can say with certainty that they were true descendants of Cao </span><span class="SpellE" >Cao</span><span >.</span></span></p>

						<p><span >Meanwhile, the research group found that among the 8 families who denied being Cao <span class="SpellE">Cao&#39;s</span> descendants but instead the descendants of Cao Can, their Y chromosomes lacked M268 genetic markers but had the 002611 genetic marker belonging to the O3a4 haplogroup. Therefore, this century old mystery was easily answered. The secret codes contained within blood confirmed that Cao <span class="SpellE">Cao</span> had falsified his family origin pretending to come from a family with both power and wealth.</span></p>

						<p ><b ><span >4. The teeth of Cao Ding authenticated the research result</span></b></p>

						<p ><b ><span >&nbsp;</span></b></p>

						<p ><st1:state ><span >Henan&#39;</span></st1:state><span >s archeological research institute insisted that the tomb excavated from <st1:place ><st1:placename >Anyang</st1:placename> <st1:placetype >Province</st1:placetype></st1:place> had the skeleton of Cao <span class="SpellE">Cao</span>. Moreover, they said. There is nothing that cannot undergo DNA testing.<span >&nbsp; </span>However, they refused the request to obtain a small sample from the skeleton. The research group then had to enlist the help from <st1:place ><st1:placename >Anhui</st1:placename> <st1:placetype >Province</st1:placetype></st1:place> since a tooth from Cao Ding was found in Anhui Cao Ding clan&#39;s cemetery. This tooth was found amidst a pile of debris in an envelope in a warehouse from which the research team obtained a sample for DNA analysis. </span></p>

						<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p ><span >Cao Ding was the brother of Cao <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cao&#39;s</span></span><span class="GramE"><span >&nbsp; </span>grandfather</span>.<span >&nbsp; </span>Based on Y chromosome analyses, it has the same Y chromosome genetic markers as the present day descendants of Cao <span class="SpellE">Cao</span>. That is to say, conclusions from analyzing the blood samples from present day descendants of Cao <span class="SpellE">Cao</span> are completely authentic. Finally, the Y chromosome of Cao <span class="SpellE">Cao&#39;s</span> DNA genetic markers was confirmed. Again, this method of tracing ones ancestor by DNA testing received further affirmation (Reference 6). In fact, obtain a small sample, about one millimeter diameter, from the bone will not damage the bone in any way. One therefore wonders if the <st1:city ><st1:place >Anyang</st1:place></st1:city> tomb Is truly Cao <span class="SpellE">Cao&#39;s</span> skeleton, why did the officials resisted DNA confirmation?</span></p>
