As pointed out in the report of its discovery, it is a fixed genetic marker. It was born at the origin of mankind following modern humans spreading all around the world.

It cannot divide into haplogroups. Its function is to identify humans by:(1)to trace back to mankind&rsquo;s one and only pair of ancestors, namely, &ldquo;scientific Adam&rdquo; and &ldquo;scientific Eve&rdquo;; (2) to identify ethnic groups from the past or living today whether or not they are the descendants of &ldquo;scientific Adam&rdquo; and &ldquo;scientific Eve&rdquo;;(3) to identify whether or not the human blood contains &ldquo;impurities&rdquo; (from heterogeneous mating) because this marker will be lost if there exists such &ldquo;impurities&rdquo;. </span></p><p ><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p ><span>The &ldquo;first genetic marker&rdquo; thoroughly resolved many queries and debates in the past concerning whether or not there were non modern human elements in human genetics.

This &ldquo;high hat&rdquo; is a long DNA sequence known as telomere. Telomere&rsquo;s main DNA structure is formed from repeated replication of six DNA letter chain (TTAGGG&rdquo;). On different chromosomes, the number of replications on telomere differs <span class="GramE">between 500 to 2,000</span>. Telomere&rsquo;s total length (dependent on the number of replications) <span>is reduced<i></i></span>with the number of cell divisions. </span></span><span class="hps"><span lang="EN">The baby&#39;s</span></span><span class="longtext"><span>telomere</span></span><span class="hps"><span lang="EN">s of chromosomes have</span></span><span lang="EN"><span class="hps">maximum</span><span class="hps">number of repetitions</span><span class="hps">and the number of repetitions</span><span class="hps">will be reduced</span> with age increases<span class="hps">.</span></span><span class="longtext"><span>Nonetheless, the telomere length in sperm chromosomes is almost the same regardless of the age of men.

Yes, but very little. In Figure 6-3 which represents part of the chromosomal telomere, on can see the orderly arrangement of &ldquo;TTAGGG&rdquo;. Remember this is just part of the telomere sequence but it contains 250 replications. Compare this with the 789 letter sequence below with merely a few &ldquo;TTAGGG&rdquo; replications scattered among the sequence. If there is a head-to-head <span class="GramE">chromosomal<span>&nbsp; </span>(</span>telomere to telomere)fusion, even assuming some loss, it is hard to imagine that starting with twice as many &ldquo;500 to 2,000 replications&rdquo; only a few and sparsely scattered replications are left. </span></span></p><p ><span class="longtext"><span>Scientists can perform comparative analysis when faced with the human DNA decoding sequence.</span></span></p><p ><span class="longtext"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p ><span class="longtext"><span><span>&nbsp;</span>However, in most cases, one must be careful with this type of explanation. For example within the 789 letter sequence, there is a code<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&quot;<span class="SpellE">ttaggg</span><span class="SpellE">tt</span><span class="SpellE">ttaggg</span>&quot; which someone will say it is nothing but replication of two chains with the addition of two <span class="GramE">letters<span>&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;</span>TTAGGG &#39;TT&#39; TTAGGG&rdquo;. If everybody has this sequence at this locus of the </span></span></span><span class="hps"><span lang="EN">Chromosome</span></span><span class="longtext"><span> 2, then, there could not have been any mutational involvement. Then we need to ask this question: Who is sufficient qualification to verify that these two letters were added during chromosomal fusion 200,000 years ago? The most reasonable and most direct and simple explanation is this: this is not the combination of two letter chains &lsquo;TTAGGG&rdquo;. Based on this type of analysis, the real combination together (like the aforementioned telomere criteria string) merely involves the two chains in this sequence region: </span></span><span class="longtext"><span>&quot;TTAGGG <span class="SpellE">TTAGGG</span><i>&quot;.</i></span></span></p><p ><span class="longtext"><span>There are over </span></span><span>2 hundred million<span class="longtext"><span> DNA letters on chromosome 2. The DNA code is formed from merely four letters &ldquo;A<span class="GramE">,T</span>. G, C&rdquo;. Within the entire sequence, regions containing these two letter chains must be more than one. To use such sequence as confirmatory evidence of the fusion of two <span class="GramE">chromosome</span> is simply hard to believe.</span></span></span><span class="longtext"></span></p><p ><span class="longtext"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p ><span class="longtext"><span>Besides, the function of the &ldquo;high hat&rdquo; (telomere) is to prevent the fusion among chromosomes.

This section is set out to prove this: After the first person&rsquo;s chromosome 2 was formed carrying this particular genetic marker, those who carried this same genetic marker on chromosome 2 their chromosome 2 must have gone through rigorous replication. It is impossible to generate it in a random manner. </span></span></p><p ><span class="hps"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p ><span class="hps"><span>To determine the possibility of a random occurrence, one needs to express the probability of occurrence. To illustrate the concept of probability, the simplest is the dice theory.<span>&nbsp; </span>Therefore, we will use the dice theory to begin our discussion in this section. </span></span></p><p ><span>The simple way to illustrate the dice theory is to toss a coin and let it drop. The probability of head or tail facing up is the same, namely 50%. Another commonly used example is a hexahedral dice. After tossing the dice numbered 1 to 6, the probability of any one number facing up is 1/6. </span></p><p ><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p ><span>Here we will be discussing a special dice: a four sided dice. Most people may not be familiar with this 4 sided dice. It is formed from four equilateral triangles on a plane surface as shown in Figure 6-4. After tossing it in the air, only one side will face down when it falls on the <span class="GramE">ground .</span> If we write the four DNA letters &ldquo;A, T, C<span class="GramE">,G</span>&rdquo; on all the four sides of this dice, the probability of one letter facing down is one in four or 25%.</span></p><p ><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p ><span>In the lower corner of Figure 6-4, we can use the 4 sided dice with DNA consisting of 789 letters abbreviated as &ldquo;dice&rdquo; to represent the 789 letters of the first genetic marker. The Figure expresses the first 6 letters as well as last 3 letters omitting 780 letters.</span></p><p ><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p ><span>If we use the random method and toss these 789 letters dice, after it falls, what is the probability of accurately forming the first genetic marker sequence? From the theoretical analysis, how many times does one need to toss to obtain the same sequence? This is a problem for probabilistic analysis.</span></p><p ><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p ><span class="hps"><span>We start our discussion by using the genetic marker&rsquo;s first dice (T). On average one needs to toss it 4 times to get a &lsquo;T&rdquo; as the dice falls on the ground. For example, if we toss the dice 400 times, &lsquo;T&rsquo; will appear 100 times as the dice falls on the ground. For the genetic marker with two dices )T, T), one must toss </span></span><span>4&times;4=4<sup>2</sup>=16 times before both letters TT will appear for the first after falling to the ground. Thus, the probability is 1/16.</span></p><p ><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p ><span>For the genetic marker with three dices TTG, on average one must toss 4&times;4&times;4=4<sup>3</sup>=64 times before the three letters TTG will appear for the first time after falling to the ground. Thus, the probability is 1/64.</span></p><p ><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p ><span>For the 789 dice, one need to toss 4<sup>789 </sup>=1.06&times;<span class="GramE">10<sup>475 </sup><span>&nbsp;</span>before</span> identical to the first genetic marker will appear for the first time when it falls to the ground. Thus, the probability is 1&times;10<sup>-475</sup>.</span></p><p ><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p ><span>If the first genetic marker is randomly created on chromosome 2 with the identical <span class="GramE">sequence ,</span> the same starting point on the long arm 2q14.1, and also the starting point is located on 108305. There are 2,400,000 loci on chromosome 2. If we start from the probability inference, the starting point could be on any locus on the </span><span>243.2</span><span>MB loci. However, only this locus (108305) satisfies the requirement. The probability of the starting point of this sequence on this locus is one in 243.2 million.</span></p><p ><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p ><span>Combining the two probabilities from above and randomly creating the first genetic marker on chromosome 2, the probability rate is: </span></p><p ><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p ><span>(1&times;10<sup>-475 </sup>)&times; (1/243,200,000)= 0.41&times;10<sup>-483</sup></span></p><p ><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p ><span>Therefore, to randomly create the same chromosome the probability rate is 0.41&times;10<sup>-483</sup>(0.000&hellip;..41 decimal point and4 with 483 of 0 in between)</span></p><p ><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p ><span class="hps"><span lang="EN">Thus</span></span><span lang="EN">, <span class="hps">a formula</span><span class="hps">is established</span> that <span class="hps">estimates the probability of produce for the</span><span class="hps">same</span><span class="hps">DNA</span><span class="hps">sequence:</span></span><span class="hps"></span></p><p ><span class="hps"><span lang="EN">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p ><span lang="EN">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><b><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P=1/</span></b><b><span lang="ZH-CN">（</span></b><b><span>L&times;4<sup>N</sup></span></b><b><span lang="ZH-CN">）</span></b><b></b><span lang="ZH-CN"><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span class="hps"><span lang="EN"><span>&nbsp;</span>,</span></span><span lang="EN"> L - <span class="hps">length of the chromosome</span><span class="atn">; N-</span>sequence length<br /><br /></span></p><p ><span class="hps"><b><span lang="EN">This formula</span></b></span><b><span lang="EN"><span class="hps">is</span> the key of <span class="hps">DNA</span><span class="hps">decoding</span>.</span></b></p><p ><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p ><span>In the probability theory event which is close to the probability of zero is called &ldquo;small probability event&rdquo;. We can practically consider it impossible to occur with such a very, very small probability event. For example, if we toss 789 coins into the air and expect all of the heads to face upward as they fall on the ground by once, it is impossible. For the 4 sided DNA dice, the probability is even small than the previously mentioned coin tossing because it is 4 sided and just 2 sided.</span></p><p ><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p ><span>There is no second type of chromosome 2 found in humans. If the chromosome 2 is randomly created, we must assume that it is created with &ldquo;one throw&rdquo; just as the first created chromosome 2.
