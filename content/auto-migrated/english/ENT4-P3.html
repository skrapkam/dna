There is, in fact, already an answer to this question. The answer came from the analyses of DNA samples collected from the millions of Europeans and European immigrants who lived in North America. Their patrilineal ancestor was a male with the M168 genetic marker and their matrilineal ancestor was a woman with the L3 genetic marker. They were all, without exception, descendants of Y chromosome Adam and Mitochondrial Eve.&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>.<br /> Then, who were the descendants of the ancient peoples or Australopithecus? How did they live? Who was Otzi the Iceman? Were the Cro-Magnon people ancestors of the Europeans? Were the Neanderthal ancestors of Europeans? Fortunately, by using DNA decoding, we could get a clear cut answer to all these questions..</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>.<br /><strong>I. Was Otzi the Iceman an extinct race?</strong></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>.<br /> Some reports claim that Otzi the Iceman is an extinct race. This, however, is a big misunderstanding. &nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p></o:p><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hps"><b><span><img alt="" src="/ENT4-P3_files/4-6.jpg" /></span></b></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hps"><b><span>Figure 4-6: Relevant Photos of the Otzi the Iceman</span><o:p></o:p></b></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hps"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hps"><b><span>1.Reports about Otzi the Iceman<o:p></o:p></span></b></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>.&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hps"><span>In 1991, German mountain climbers, Mr. Simon and Mrs. Simon, discovered a well-preserved corpse on top of Otzi Mountain on the Italian side of the Austrian-Italian border. This corpse was named Iceman Otzi (or Otzi Iceman). Soon after this discovery, scientists began to meticulously research Iceman Otzi.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hps"><span>.<br /> Iceman Otzi lived about 5,300 years ago and died at around 45 years old. He was 1.65 meters tall and weighed 50 kilograms. He wore straw-weaved robe, leather vests and waterproof shoes made from bear and deerskin.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hps"><span>.<br /> Based on the analyses of pollen, dust and enamel from his tooth, Iceman Otzi spent his childhood in Bolzano in the northern part of Italy. An autopsy revealed that he had blackened lungs, which presumably was due to prolonged inhalation of campfire smoke. Analyses of his gastrointestinal contents revealed that he ate lamb and red deer meat, cereals, fruits and bread within 8 hours of his death,<br /> Hair analyses showed that his hair contained a high level of copper and arsenic particles because Otzi carried an axe made of high purity (99.7%) copper. Scientists hypothesized that Otzi participated in copper refinery work.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hps"><span>.<br /> Another autopsy finding revealed an arrow wound in his shoulder. Even though the shaft of the arrow was pulled out, but the arrowhead was left behind in his body. Iceman Otzi&rsquo;s attempt to pull out the arrowhead aggravated his wound and thus he died from excessive blood loss. He was getting ready to go to the valley 8 hours prior to death and had placed his copper axe and quiver containing 14 arrows beside him. One can deduce from this that Otzi was resting with his belongings next to him before he died. &nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hps"><span>.<br /> In addition to these weapons, the Iceman also carried along some drugs, some with stimulant properties. &nbsp;The Iceman&rsquo;s body is covered with over 50 tattoos in the form of groups of lines and crosses. Thus, the tattoos were probably one for therapeutic measures rather than for aesthetic purposes. Several groups of vertical lines are located to the left and right of the spinal column, on the left calf, on the right instep and on the inner and outer ankle joint. Two lines cross the left wrist. A cross-shaped mark appears on the back of the right knee and beside the left Achilles tendon. The locations of these tattoos are comparable to Chinese acupuncture points. These tattoos were perhaps there to treat the parasites in his digestive system as well as to treat degenerative bone disease.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hps"><span>.<br /> It is indeed amazing and truly invaluable that scientists had obtained such detailed information from this person who lived over 5,300 years ago. However, who was his ancestor? Who were his descendants? One can only find answers to these questions by analyzing his DNA decoding.&nbsp;</span></span><br /> &nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hps"><b><span>2.

Therefore, another name for Iceman Otzi is Tyrolean Iceman. Since the Iceman was discovered at the Austrian-Italian border, there were several disputes concerning ownership. The final and most accurate site determination placed the Iceman within 92.56 meter of the Italian border. Thus, the Iceman is kept in the Italian archaeological museum in the city of Bolzano. In recent years, this museum showcases exceedingly clear photos of the Iceman on its website: http://www.icemanphotoscan.eu/</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hps"><span>.<br /> They are truly amazing!&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hps"><span>.<br /> In the 2008 November issue of &ldquo;Current Biology&rdquo;, there was a publication entitled: Complete Mitochondrial Genome Sequence of the Tyrolean Iceman. The authors were from the Institute for Biomedical Technologies, National Research Council of the University of Camerino in Italy and the University of Leeds in the UK.(Reference 1). The analysis of mitochondrial DNA decoding not only furthered our understanding of the Iceman but also clarified his maternal origin. This information could not have been obtained from an ordinary autopsy on the Iceman.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hps"><span>.<br /> Moreover, scientists obtained the complete sequence of Otzi&rsquo;s mitochondrial DNA. This is currently the first and most complete mitochondrial DNA sequence of the most ancient &ldquo;modern man&rdquo;. Scientists compared the sequence with the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) and found a30-letter code difference. They then listed every mutational change for each letter code.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hps"><span>.<br /> Meanwhile, scientists compared Otzi&rsquo;s sequence with the DNA mutational loci on the Mitochondrial lineage tree and confirmed that Otzi&rsquo;s maternal lineage belongs to a branch below the K1 haplogroup, with the K1e haplogroup being the closest branch. Based on this publication, experts who managed the matrilineal lineage tree named the Iceman&rsquo;s mitochondrial DNA haplogroup the K1f haplogroup.&nbsp;</span></span><br /> &nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hps"><b><span><img alt="" src="/ENT4-P3_files/4-7.jpg" /></span></b></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hps"><b><span>Figure 4-7 The location of Iceman Otzi&rsquo;s Mitochondrial DNA Haplogroups</span><o:p></o:p></b></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hps"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="ListParagraph"><b><span>3.
