The cells in the human body contain similar <span class="GramE">DNA(</span> deoxyribonucleic acid), the carrier of genetic information. Human DNA almost exclusively resides within the nucleus. Within the nucleus, the genetic information resides within the chromosomes. There are 23 pairs of chromosomes (or a total of 46) in human cells. Chromosomes can be divided into two different types, namely autosomes and sex chromosomes. In every cell, there are 22 pairs of autosomes (one from the father and one from the mother) and one pair of sex chromosomes. In a girl, her sex chromosomes will be XX, one from each parent. In a boy, the sex chromosomes will be XY with the Y chromosome for the father and the X chromosome from the mother. </span></p><p ><span>.</span></p><p ><b><span lang="EN">Currently, there are three methods for paternity testing:</span></b></p><p ><span lang="EN">&nbsp;</span></p><p ><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN">1)<span class="SpellE">Autosomal</span></span></span><span lang="EN"> paternity testing: Since half of the <span class="SpellE">autosomal</span> chromosomes come from the father and half from the mother, it is possible to determine the parents of the child with the <span class="SpellE">Autosomal</span> Testing method. </span></p><p ><span lang="EN">&nbsp;</span></p><p ><span class="GramE"><span lang="EN">2)Y</span></span><span lang="EN">-chromosomal paternity test: This test focuses the determination of parentage in the male line only.

Genetic Markers in Our Body</span></b></p><p ><span>The genetic markers on the Y chromosome record our ethnic genealogy. Except for the &ldquo;ZFY region&rdquo; on the Y chromosome found in modern men world wide and the aforementioned Adam&rsquo;s genetic marker, all the rest of the genetic markers are the result of mutations.</span></p><p ><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p ><span class="hps"><span>Molecular anthropology research identifies two type of genetic markers on the Y chromosome, one being the aforementioned &ldquo;Short Tandem Repeat &ldquo;(STR) for father-son confirmation for thousands of years. The other is the &ldquo;Single Nucleotide Polymorphism<span class="GramE">&rdquo;(</span>SNP)<span>&nbsp; </span>in different ethnic groups. For <span class="GramE">example ,</span> mutation occurred on the DNA sequence number 20, 224, 062 on the Y chromosome of the<span>&nbsp; </span>ancestors of Han ethnic group in <st1:country-region ><st1:place >China</st1:place></st1:country-region> in which nucleobase pair T became C (Reference 6). Subsequently, all the descendents from this ethnic group possess this genetic marker. However, the SNP from the Dai ethnic group from <st1:country-region ><st1:place >China</st1:place></st1:country-region> still retains the original nucleobase pair T. </span></span></p><p ><span class="hps"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p ><span class="hps"><span>On the same genetic locus from different ethnic groups, one can find different genetic markers with addition or deletion of certain nucleobase pair, thus the term&rdquo; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism&rdquo;(SNP) Since the mutation rate of SNP is low, it can be retained almost forever from generation to generation. If a mutation occurs in one generation, the new mutation will be added on to the former ancestors&rsquo; mutations. Therefore, the mutations from our ancestors are never lost at any time point. Based on SNP genetic markers one can trace our ancestors from </span></span><b><span>over a hundred thousand</span></b><span class="hps"><b></b></span><span class="hps"><span>of years ago.</span></span></p><p ><span class="hps"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><b></b></p><p ><span class="hps"><span>Our paternal ethnic genealogy is recorded on the genetic markers on the Y chromosome. In 2000, an international research team of researchers at <st1:place ><st1:placename >Stanford</st1:placename><st1:placetype >University</st1:placetype></st1:place> discovered 167 markers on the DNA sequence (Reference 6) which were given difference names i.e. M168, M173, M343, M175 etc. Since this discovery, this tracking of human origin from DNA finally emerged from the mysterious temple of molecular anthropology so that you and I could trace and confirm our paternal ancestry from this rich database.</span></span></p><p ><span>In the last decade since 2000, millions of Y chromosome DNA samples around the world have been tested. The genetic markers have increased to 1,400 (Reference 7). </span></p><p ><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p ><span>Therefore, scientists could more meticulously differentiate ethnic groups based on these genetic markers. Humans around the world can be subdivided into even smaller haplogroups (Reference 8). The same ethnic group will have the same Y chromosome haplogroups or the same paternal genetic markers. Aforementioned 167 genetic markers have been proven to be absolutely correct. Therefore, with just a drop of blood you can trace you ancestors from several thousand generations up to the Y-chromosome Adam. Using these genetic markers within our <span class="GramE">bodies</span> worldwide, scientists can depict mankind&rsquo;s paternal family trees and their migration history.</span></p><p ><span class="hps">&nbsp;</span></p><p ><span class="hps"><span>The following is a real example of the birth of a &ldquo;genetic marker&rdquo;:</span></span></p><p ><span class="hps"><span>Approximately 30,000 year ago, when humans migrated from Africa to certain region in <st1:place >Asia Minor</st1:place>, a fertilized egg developed into a male fetus. In his Y chromosome (Y position NCBI36: No.13535818) the original nucleobase A suddenly became C during a mutational change. This mutation gave birth to a new genetic marker called M173. All descendants from this novel M173 will carry the specific genetic type, namely, the R1-type <span class="SpellE">haplogroup</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of course, this terminology is easy to remember. </span></span></p><p ><span class="hps"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p ><span class="hps"><span>Every descendant with the R1-type <span class="SpellE">haplogroup</span> carries this special &ldquo;DNA imprint&rdquo;. Who are these people?</span></span></p><p ><span class="hps"><span><span>&nbsp;</span>They were the ancestors of peoples living in central and western Europe. That is to say that peoples living in these regions share a common paternal ancestor M173. Similar to blood typing, there are many research laboratories with the capability of confirming this DNA marker with just a drop of blood or oral mucosa. Analysis of DNA samples from several hundreds of thousands of people proved this conclusion is correct.</span></span><span class="hps"><span lang="EN"> Has not found</span></span><span lang="EN"><span class="hps">any other</span><span class="hps">race,</span><span class="hps">for example,</span><span class="hps">Africa</span><span class="hps">has</span><span class="hps">labeled</span><span class="hps">aboriginal</span><span class="hps">M61</span>, <span class="hps">M175</span><span class="hps">marker</span><span class="hps">in <st1:place >Asia</st1:place></span><span class="hps">with</span><span class="hps">Aborigines</span><span class="hps">on the Y-Chromosome</span><span class="hps">in this position</span><span class="hps">to have this</span><span class="hps">mutation.</span></span></p><p ><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p ><span>Marker M173, on this locus this is the only mutation, without duplication and no reverse mutation is found on this locus. That is to say that regardless of where you live on this earth if the DNA testing shows that on this locus is a &lsquo;C&rdquo; then you must be a descendant of M173. You belong to the R1-type haplogroup. Or else, you don&rsquo;t belong to this haplogroup ethnic group. M173 is a Y-chromosome marker <span class="GramE">with<span>&nbsp; </span>50,000,000</span> nucleobase pairs. It is like a grain <span class="GramE">of<span>&nbsp; </span>sand</span> in a huge desert. Nonetheless, in human genetics during embryonic development with cell divisions and the formation of the fetus, the same letter &lsquo;C&rsquo; remains irrevocably unchanged on the same locus despite billions of replications. What an amazing fact! From this observation we can say with certainty that the Y chromosome has not undergone any evolutionary change. This fact serves as the foundation on which molecular anthropology is built.</span></p><p ><span><img alt="Image" border="0" height="499" src="ENT2-P1_files/image005.jpg"  width="665" /></span></p><p ><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p ><span class="hps"><b><span>Figure 2-4 Distribution</span></b></span><b><span><span class="hps">map of the descendants of M173</span></span></b></p><p ><span class="hps"><span lang="EN">Let us continue to</span></span><span lang="EN"><span class="hps">expand</span><span class="hps">our story.</span><span class="hps"><span>&nbsp;</span>We do not know</span><span class="hps">what</span><span class="hps">led</span> the M173 <span class="hps">descendants</span><span class="hps">moved firmly</span><span class="hps">westward</span> into the <span class="hps">middle of</span><span class="hps">modern <st1:place >Europe</st1:place></span>. <span class="hps">It took</span><span class="GramE">a further <span class="hps">thousands</span></span><span class="hps"> of years</span><span class="hps">later for one of his progeny</span><span class="hps">inside</span><span class="hps">a</span><span class="hps">boy. </span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="hps">In his</span><span class="hps">process of</span><span class="hps">embryonic development</span>, the Y-position NCBI36: <span class="hps">No.</span><span class="hps">2947824</span><span class="hps">loci</span>, the original <span class="hps">DNA of</span><span class="hps">the character</span><span class="hps">&#39;C&#39;,</span><span class="hps">instantaneously</span><span class="hps">changed</span><span class="hps">the</span><span class="hps">&#39;A&#39;,</span><span class="hps">which in turn is</span><span class="hps">a</span><span class="hpsatn">new &quot;</span>mutation.&quot; <span class="hps">Thus,</span><span class="hps">a</span><span class="hps">new DNA</span><span class="hps">genetic marker</span><span class="hps">was</span><span class="hps">born</span>.

However, the ZFY genetic marker or &ldquo;Adam&rsquo;s marker&rdquo; not only is the only one based on one gene, but also is the longest with 729 DNA codes. It so <span class="GramE">happens</span> that it is this genetic marker which falls within the area of medical research. It was accidentally discovered by medical research scientists as they did DNA sequence comparisons. Just think, if this genetic marker occurs in the DNA &ldquo;desert region&rdquo;, who would want to find a grain of sand in the vast desert? Even if someone <span class="GramE">try</span> to do so, how long would it take him to find this most important &ldquo;signpost&rdquo;? Maybe one hundred, even several hundreds of years later. It is truly amazing that the &ldquo;Adam marker&rdquo; was discovered very early within the area of medical research.</span></span></p><p ><span><span>&nbsp;</span><b>VII.Our <span class="shorttext">Paternal genetic tree</span></b></span></p><p ><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p ><span class="hps"><span lang="EN">According to results of recent</span></span><span lang="EN"><span class="hps">research,</span> the <span class="hps">drawing illustrates</span><span class="hps">a new</span><span class="hps"><b>Y-Chromosome</b></span></span><span class="shorttext"><b><span>Paternal genetic tree</span></b></span><span lang="EN">.</span></p><p ><b></b></p><p >.</p><p ><b><span><img alt="" src="/ENT2-P1_files/image21006.jpg" /></span></b></p><p ><b><span>Figure 2-5 The <span class="shorttext">Paternal genetic tree</span></span></b><b><span lang="EN">. </span></b><b></b></p><p ><span class="hps"><span lang="EN">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p ><span class="hps"><span lang="EN">For example</span></span><span lang="EN">: </span><span>Above the European haplogroup R1, one sees the M173 genetic marker.
