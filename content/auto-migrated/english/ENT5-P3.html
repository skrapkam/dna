From subsequent investigation, it is estimated that there were 318,000 to 1000,000 people living there and similar to the distribution of present day Australians. Most of they lived along the southwest coast region and the <st1:place w:st="on">Murray River</st1:place> region.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hps"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>The Australian aborigines were not backward when compared to ancient&#39;s peoples from other continents. They have all kinds of stone tools, javelin, and boats made from tree bark and the worlds only boomerang. About four to five thousand years ago, they also entered the Neolithic Age. They have ax with a wooden handle, harpoon with a fish hook, and javelin with a bag containing dozens of small flint blades made from cut stones. May be because they could not exchange technological information with other ethnic groups, the Australian aborigines nerved entered the Bronze Age. They also failed to produced the bows and arrows commonly used in other regions of the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>From south to north of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, we can find may ancient <span class="SpellE">petroglyphs</span>. The smooth line patterns and vivid characters of human beings and animals all point to a high standard in painting at the time. Using the modern dating methods, archeologists confirmed the coloring used in the <span class="SpellE">petroglyphs</span> at the Arnhem Land <span class="SpellE">Malakunanjo</span> II rock shelter on the western part of Australia dated back to 50,000 years ago (Reference 1). Even though they did not have a written language, but they had orally transmitted myths and stories about their ancestors. There were strict social organization, marriage system and rules in many, many of their tribes. Each tribe had its own territory.<span>&nbsp; </span>They did not lack food. Their bodies were healthy.

Early this century, the earliest research goal of molecular anthropologists was the study of the Australian aborigines. Based on DNA decoding, it was easily confirmed that the Australian aborigines were the descendants of M168 and descendants of a branch of M130.

There was a period around 60,000 to 65,000 years ago when the sea level was lower by 80 to 100 meter compared to the sea level today. Based on this information one can draw out the travelling distance (Figure 5-16). From this map, one can see that at that time, the travelling distance was much narrower only 150 miles as compared to the 600 miles today. That is to say the ancient modern men had chosen an auspicious time to migrate to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Pushing the time back 60,000 years, it was not an easy task for our ancestors to cross the vast ocean even though it was only 150 miles.

What is amazing is the fact that from the production of the bamboo raft to the entire crossing was entirely based on the technology and lifestyle at the mid Paleolithic age. They used stone ax to chop the bamboo, bundled bamboo with rattan to form <span class="GramE">a</span> 18 meter raft. They also used some blades of stone to make the javelin for fishing, cooked meals with wild millet and drilled fire to obtain a fire for cooking (Reference 4). </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Relying on these primitive conditions, the five of them started their journey on this raft on December 17, 1998 without an escort boat or radio and left <st1:country-region w:st="on">Indonesia&#39;</st1:country-region>s <st1:placename w:st="on">Timor</st1:placename><st1:placetype w:st="on">Island</st1:placetype> port and courageously sailed towards <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.

Based on this nearly 1000 miles of sailing project, they firmly believed that the ancient people 60,000 years ago did have the capability to cross the <st1:place w:st="on">Timor Sea</st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>When crossing the <st1:place w:st="on">Timor Sea</st1:place>, how were the ancient people 60,000 years ago differ from them? First, 60,000 years ago, the <st1:place w:st="on">Timor Sea</st1:place> was only 150 KM wide as compared to 600 KM today. That was definitely an advantage for the ancient people. However, the ancient people did not know where <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region> was located. At that time, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region> faced the northern part of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Timor</st1:placename><st1:placetype w:st="on">Island</st1:placetype></st1:place>.

For the ancient people, they embarked on an unchartered journey. It is impossible for us to know what motivation or faith these ancient people had at that time which led them to undertake such a courageous journey. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>The ancient people obviously had less scientific knowledge at that time. However, the ancient people were just as smart as Bob <span class="SpellE">Hobman</span> and his colleagues even more so when it came to building the bamboo raft. For 60,000 years, human beings did not undergo evolution. From the viewpoint of evolution, it is possible that 60,000 years ago, the ancient people were still apes.

In the lengthy time period after 60,000 years, in particular the most recent several thousands of years, it is unavoidable to find later immigrants who carry the M89 genetic marker. These later immigrants are descendants of those who left <st1:place w:st="on">Africa</st1:place>. However, over 65% of the majority of these aborigines, we find the M130 genetic marker.

From the previous page we learn that the maternal haplogroup L3 accompanied M130&#39;s descendants who left <st1:place w:st="on">Africa</st1:place>. Many generations of daughters after L3 created genetic markers M and N due to subsequent mutations. The grand daughters of M and N (of course the grand daughters of M130) accompanied the grand sons of M130 (of course M and N&#39;s grandsons) continued to migrate to far away places (Please refer to Figure 2-11 Maternal Genetic tree in Page 2 of Part2). <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>.&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>There are two major mitochondrial haplogroups in Australian aborigines.

In the aforementioned report concerning mitochondrial DNA estimation, M42 haplogroup was born between 40,000 to 50,000 years ago and S haplogroup between 20,000 to 30,000 years ago.

Another possibility is that the children and grandchildren of M347 married wives who came from either the M haplogroup or the N haplogroup. After crossing the <st1:place w:st="on">Timor Sea</st1:place>, M42 was created from M and S from N due to mutation. We can speculate that only a very small number of people in a family actually crossed the <st1:place w:st="on">Timor Sea</st1:place>.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><span></span><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hps"><b><span>.<img alt="" src="/ENT5-P3_files/0ce5-3-5.jpg" /></span></b></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hps"><b><span>Figure 5-20</span></b></span><b><span><span class="hps">Australian Aborigines</span><span class="hps">Y chromosome</span><span class="hps">haplogroups</span><span class="hps">and mitochondrial</span><span class="hps">haplogroups</span></span><span class="hps"><o:p></o:p></span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>3.

They were a lonely ethnic group oversea. Therefore, their Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA constituted one family in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Yet, a very special phenomenon is that in both the Australian aborigines and the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New Guinea</st1:place></st1:country-region> aborigines the Q2 haplogroup genetic marker was simultaneously found.

This is why DNA decoding is so unique in anthropological research. From the Y chromosome genetic marker M347&#39;s location on the paternal genetic tree we can see that Australian aborigines were descendants of M130. From this we can depict the migratory route of their ancestors from Africa to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>. We can find out the close relationship between people in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region> and those from <st1:country-region w:st="on">Indonesia</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> and <st1:place w:st="on">Africa</st1:place>. We could establish the distribution <span class="GramE">map around the world by connect</span> the M130 branches and the M130 from Asia and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Americas</st1:place></st1:country-region> simultaneously on this same map (Please see the front cover of this book).

Moving even further upward, we could trace it back to Y chromosome Adam (Please see Figure 2-5 mankind��s paternal genetic tree). Likewise if we searching upward in time beginning with the Australian with the female genetic markers M42 and S, we could find M and N 70,000 years ago and then L3 until mitochondrial Eve.
