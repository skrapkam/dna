Meanwhile, human paternal and maternal migration histories are described respectively according to the genetic markers of mutation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>.<br /> The majority of human DNA sequences, however, are contained in autosomes. There is no difference between male&rsquo;s autosomes and female&rsquo;s autosomes. One question is: Are there any markers on the 22 autosomes of human beings? Through research, we found that such markers do exist in the autosomes and are in great numbers. One can see eight markers in such DNA coding sequence in Appendix of this book (Appendix: Information of DNA Codes in Gene Bank). These are &ldquo;inherent markers&rdquo; that have never changed since birth of human beings, which fully proves that all modern human beings are the offspring of Scientific Adam and Scientific Eve.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>.<br /> To measure the probability that all human beings share the same origin - Scientific Adam, we have introduced the probability theory and created P formula. It can be used as a key for DNA sequence decoding. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span><o:p><strong>I. The significance of the markers on the autosomes</strong></o:p></span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>.<br /> However, within our common understanding concerning the aforementioned &ldquo;the common ancestors two hundred thousand years ago&rdquo;, there still exist some questions which demand answers. &nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>.<br /> Such as: Since these results do not imply that the man and the woman were the only living persons in that distant era, one can almost certainly conclude that many other people also lived in that era. It just so happened, the genetic lineages of other people&rsquo;s Y chromosome (in the case of men) and mitochondria (in the case of women) did not pass on to the subsequent generations, they simply became extinct. The two common ancestors were just &ldquo;lucky enough&rdquo;.&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>.<br /> It is an important question for scientists of molecular anthropology: whether many human beings had evolved but the common ancestors were The Sole pair who had offspring to current?</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>.<br /> If a couple has only daughters but no son, the Y chromosome from the father will not be inherited. In the same way, if they have no daughter, the mitochondria from the mother will be lost. However, their autosomes were all inherited by their sons or daughters, so the autosomes must have evidence of their DNA, which their children inherited.</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>.<br /> We can attribute all these concerns to the following question:</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>.<br /> Did the individuals who lived during the same time period as Y-chromosome Adam and Mitochondrial Eve, have the same genetic markers as Y-chromosome Adam and Mitochondrial Eve?&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>.<br /><strong>1.</strong> If they possessed the same genetic markers as Y-chromosome Adam and Mitochondrial Eve, the answer will be simple. We can then be certain that there were many similar people like Y-chromosome Adam and Mitochondrial Eve, those were their brothers, sisters or cousins. We can call them the &ldquo;people with common ancestors&rdquo; just as all the people living on earth today with the same genetic markers as Mitochondrial Eve or Y-chromosome Adam. Hence, we all come from the common ancestors two hundred thousand years ago.</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>.<br /><strong>2.</strong> If the answer to the aforementioned question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;: those people living at the same time as Y-chromosome Adam and Mitochondrial Eve all have their own (different) genetic markers. Then we can refer them as &ldquo;people not from the same ancestors as the Y chromosome Adam or Mitochondrial Eve&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;people not with common ancestors.&rdquo; These people do not exist today because their genetic markers did not pass on to subsequent generations due to lack of male or female descendants.&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>.<br /> From meiosis (see below) in human reproduction, it can be deduced that as long as &ldquo;people without common ancestors&rdquo; were involved in human reproduction, the autosomes are bound to leave their DNA markers. This will produce some modern people with autosomes lacking the genetic markers of most people.</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>.<br /> Therefore, the only way to resolve this debate is this: if we can find a genetic marker which everybody has on his/her autosome without exception, then we can prove that we are all from &ldquo;people with common ancestors.&rdquo;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>.<br /> If this can be proven, then we can ascertain that the lineage of modern humans is pure and uncontaminated by impurities. This is the significance of the autosomal markers.&nbsp;</o:p></span><br /><span>.<br /> .</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><strong><strong>II</strong></strong></span><span><strong>. The Human DNA &ldquo;first genetic marker&rdquo; on the autosome</strong></span></p><p class="MsoNormal">.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><strong>1. &ldquo;The first genetic marker&rdquo; is the marker which confirms mankind&rsquo;s kinship</strong></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><span><strong>.</strong></span></span><br /><span>Is there such a genetic marker on the autosome? The answer is affirmative! It resembles Y chromosome Adam Marker (729 DNA codes). This genetic marker has 789 DNA codes and is located at position 2q13 to 2q14.1 of chromosome 2 (autosome 2 long arm region 13 to 14.1). We can call it the &ldquo;first genetic marker of mankind&rdquo; (abbreviated the first genetic marker).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>.<br /> If the autosomes from everybody on earth contain the same &ldquo;first genetic marker&rdquo; and no men or women without this genetic marker were ever found, then regardless of whether the &ldquo;people without common ancestors&rdquo; existed, these people will have no kinship with people now living on earth. This is because our blood does not contain any components of the &ldquo;people without common ancestors&rdquo;. For example, even though the Java Man, Peking Man, Neanderthal Man etc. had once existed on earth, they were not the ancestors of modern humans. &nbsp;They were only apes that were unrelated to us.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>.<br /><strong>2. Did the chimpanzee&rsquo;s chromosomes 2A and 2B merge to become chromosome 2 in humans?</strong></span></p><p class="MsoNormal">.<br /><span>After decoding human DNA, some scientists hoped to use the results to prove the accuracy of the theory of evolution. They concluded that the merging between autosomes 2A and 2B produced the chromosome 2 of humans; autosomes 2A and 2B were the autosomes of the chimpanzee that have the same DNA as old ape. This conclusion is cited in many research articles and in textbooks.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>.<br /> Dr. Francis Collins, a famous molecular physiologist, supported this unproven theory strongly in his book, &ldquo;The Language of God&rdquo; (Reference 3, The Language of God P137), which subsequently influenced many people. &nbsp;Hence, we must take a serious look at this theory. Based on the analysis below, we can see that this theory has no basis.&nbsp;</span><br /> .</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>After knowing about human DNA, there are many individuals who hope that this knowledge will help prove the accuracy of the theory of evolution. Every little bit of insight which supports the theory of evolution despite the paradoxical conclusions will be viewed favorably and is published. On the contrary, if the research result contradicts the theory of evolution, it will be rejected by scientific journals because evolutionary biology is ruling the scientific world.<o:p></o:p><o:p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></o:p></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>3.

The actual process is described below:<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Spermatogonia cells each have 22 pairs of autosomes, one pair of sex chromosomes.

Therefore, gene recombination will not lead to major structural change on the chromosome.<span>&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p><span>&nbsp;Then, the first meiotic division occurs to achieve the separation of the homologous chromosomes forming two secondary spermatocytes.

The answer to this question involves the magnitude of difference among the chromosomes of humans. There are two recent articles of relevance.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>In the 2001 February 16 issue of Science which reported the fact that scientists have completed the sequencing of the human genome, only DNA samples from five individuals were used (Reference 8). These five individuals included two male and three female. They are one African American, one Chinese, one Hispanic from <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mexico</st1:place></st1:country-region> and two Caucasian (while). Of interest, DNA sample from the chief scientist of the Human Genome Project, Dr. Craig Venter, was one of the five <span class="GramE">individuals .</span><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>In the 2012 October 31 issue of Nature, an article entitled:<span class="hpsatn"><i></i>An integrated map of genetic variation from 1,092 human genomes (Reference 9)</span> reported that scientists have completed many more human DNA sequencing with samples from 1092 individuals. This research was the result of collaborative effort by scientists representing various research organizations from the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">UK</st1:country-region></st1:place>, US and China Etc<span class="GramE">. .</span> The ultimate goal of this research project was to obtain genetic information from 2,500 individuals from different ethnic groups around the world. Thousands of sample providers came from 14 countries in Europe, <st1:country-region w:st="on">America</st1:country-region>, Asia, and <st1:place w:st="on">Africa</st1:place>. The proportion of male to female ratio is 1 to 1.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>In the 2013&nbsp;January issue of the Journal of Human Genetics, there was another article entitled:&rdquo;<i></i>Southeast <st1:place w:st="on">Asia</st1:place><span class="hps">100</span><span class="hps">Malaysian</span><span class="hps">genome</span><span class="hps">deep sequencing&rdquo; (Reference 10).<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><h1><span class="hps"><span>The same conclusion from these two reports is this: the average number of DNA mutations (</span></span><span class="hps"><span>SNP &mdash;</span></span><span>Single Nucleotide Polymorphism<span class="hps">) </span></span><span class="hps"><span>are </span></span><span class="hps"><span>3.6 million DNA codes which accounts for 1.2 </span></span><span>thousandths</span><span></span><span class="hps"><span>on the 22 pairs of autosomes DNA. Since most of the DNA mutations in humans are inherited from the mutations of their ancestors, therefore, different individuals possess many similar mutations.

About 200,000 years have passed since the emergence of modern humans to the present time. Despite several tens thousands of generations&rsquo; reproduction and several dozens of generations of cell division in the bodies of each generation, these 789 DNA codes remain unchanged by a single letter in the 7 billion people living on earth is a truly amazing fact. <o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Therefore, we can say with certainty that the &ldquo;first genetic marker&rdquo; in humans is irrefutable evidence that everyone on earth comes from &ldquo;one and only one pair of parents&rdquo;. The conclusion is this: group evolution and selective evolution theories are no longer qualify to be contestants in this discussion, because according to these theories it would be impossible to evolve only &ldquo;one pair of parents&rdquo;. Whether or not the &ldquo;sudden change&rdquo; created this pair of parents from chromosomal fusion will be closely examined in the subsequent two parts.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>The other point from these two reports which deserves emphasis is the fact that these collected samples came from 50% of males and females and the researchers did not find any gender difference in their <span class="longtext"><span>autosomes DNA</span></span>. Male and female have the same <span class="longtext"><span>autosomes</span></span>. Female lacks the Y chromosome and has an additional X chromosome. Yet, there are so many gender differences. Why? Why in the first female we find the same &ldquo;first genetic marker&rdquo; as man on chromosome 2. These questions demand more studying and thought.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>To understand ourselves better with DNA decoding is just the beginning.
