The conjecture that ancestors of modern man may have mated with the Neanderthal man</span><o:p></o:p></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>After the modern man left Africa to settle in the central and western parts in Europe and Asia, they indeed lived along side of the Neanderthals man for close to 40,000 years. Even though the Neanderthals man was an ape and not truly human could it be possible that they might have mated with the ancestors of modern man during this long period of time? Could they have produced descendants? Indeed, there has been such conjecture in many people&rsquo;s mind. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>In fact, there is a very simple key to answer this question by knowing the number of pairs of chromosomes in the Neanderthals man. If the number is 24 pairs of chromosomes, then it is impossible to even entertain this conjecture. If one tries to mate a horse with a donkey, the progeny simply will not survive. The problem is that all research related to the Neanderthals man&rsquo;s DNA simply cannot determine with certainty the number of pairs of DNA they have. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Even if the Neanderthals man had 23 pairs of chromosome as human being, the progeny cannot survive. Just as the lion and tiger both having 19 pairs of chromosomes, they may give birth to a <span class="st">Liger</span> as &ldquo;children&rdquo; of this mating. However, these &ldquo;children&rdquo; will have not next generation. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>The aforementioned movie &ldquo;Quest of Fire&rdquo; describes a Neanderthal tribe that lost its only source of fire at tens of thousands of years ago. At that time only the ancestors of modern man (possibly the Cro-Magnon man) knew how to obtain fire, specifically by drilling on wood. Thus, three Neanderthals were sent out to find fire. The story is about the Neanderthal&rsquo;s quest for fire and the conflicts they have with animals and Cro-Magnons along the way.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Interestingly, these three men while robbing the seedling flame from another <span class="GramE">tribe,</span> rescued a Cro-Magnon woman leading to a mixed marriage between two very different ethnic groups. At the end of the movie, this marriage produced offspring. This film received an Oscar award. The other movie&rdquo; The last Neanderthal&rdquo; has a similar story. Nonetheless, these are stories based on the imagination of the writer and based on no any scientific evidence. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hps"><span>From the DNA perspective, there is not much difference between us and ancestors of modern man who lived over 30,000 years ago. Except for technology and the accumulation of knowledge, they were just as intelligent as we are. In the page 3 of the part 5, we will see that the ancestors of modern man who lived 60,000 years ago knew how to make the raft and crossed the wide ocean and reached Australia. The ancestors of modern European must also be the same for they were &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; who migrated from Africa. In terms of intelligence, the Neanderthal man was far inferior in comparison. From archaeological findings, the Cro-Magnon man created exquisite murals and sculptures. Except from copying the Cro-Magnon man in making spears, the Neanderthals did not create similar artistic work at all.</span></span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="ListParagraph"><b><span>2.
