The difference between Michelle and Hillary is the result of the accumulation of two different maternal developments.

That is to say, the DNA difference between Michelle and Hillary vs. mitochondrial Eve is merely </span><span class="hps"><span lang="EN">half of one</span></span><span>in one thousand. From the viewpoint of DNA, mitochondrial Eve more resembles Hillary than Michelle or we can say compared to Hillary, mitochondrial Eve more resembles Michelle. Mitochondrial Eve was thinner may be because her nutrition was not as good as Michelle or Hillary. In this way we can construct the image of mitochondrial Eve.<span>&nbsp; </span>She should look in between Michelle and Hillary. Because she had lived in Africa where the sunlight was intense, her skin color was closer to that of Michelle. </span></p><p ><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p ><span>She must be equally beautiful and smart as Michelle and Hillary. Unlike Michelle and Hillary, the only thing she lacks was <span class="GramE">the fruits from mankind&rsquo;s</span> accumulated knowledge in science and technology which these two women enjoy today. To put it simply, she was very much like us. In reality, she was like a country girl who lived in the mountains. If you gave her the opportunity, she (the mitochondrial Eve) could become an outstanding student at Princeton or Yale University.

In order to avoid a large amount of mutations leading to the death of the body, DNA has a special repair function which occurs simultaneously during the strict replication of the DNA sequence. Unlike other molecules, DNA is very special because it can make self repair after replication-related damage or errors. The DNA repair function is another guarantee for the speedy and stable replication process. The different types of DNA repair are listed belo>repair ;</span> (2) excision repair ;(3) Direct repair; (4) recombination repair;(5) error-prone repair; et.</span></p><p ><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p ><span>The already very precise DNA sequence replication is made every more precise by the aforementioned repair mechanisms. However, during the replication process, very small &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo; are created. These &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo; are the &ldquo;mutations&rdquo; which is inherited by the next generation. Because of this, during the 200,000 years and thousands of generations of inheritance of modern humans, we have an explanation of why the difference in our DNA is merely </span><span class="hps"><span lang="EN">thousandth</span></span><span>. Even more amazing if the fact that within this difference is included all the mutation markers in Y chromosome as well as the mitochondrial DNA. Because of these genetic markers, not only can we trace our ancestors but also depict mankind&rsquo;s migratory routes and history. Thus, from this viewpoint, these &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo; are no longer &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo;.</span></p><p ><b><span lang="EN">&nbsp;</span></b></p><p ><span class="hps"><span lang="EN">For example</span></span><span>, M168 genetic marker&rsquo;s letter &lsquo;T&rsquo; remains unaltered on the same locus at the DNA sequence the Y </span><span class="hps"><span lang="EN">chromosome</span></span><span> that <span class="GramE">include</span> 50 million nucleotide. This truly amazing inheritance relies on the aforementioned accuracy of DNA replication.</span></p><p ><span class="hps">&nbsp;</span></p><p ><span class="hps"><span>As mentioned before: there is &ldquo; the accuracy rate is one mismatched nucleobase pair in the replication of </span></span><span>one billion<span class="hps">nucleobase pairs&rdquo; (Reference 5).Therefore, every time during the replication of the six </span>billion<span class="hps">nucleobase pairs within the cells (three </span>billion from father and three billion from mother<span class="hps">), the replication error is merely six letters. There are no more than 50 cell divisions in every human being during his or her lifetime. Therefore, each generation, only 300 &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo; or mutations are accumulated. </span></span></p><p ><span class="hps"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p ><span class="hps"><span>From mitochondrial Eve until today, 200,000 years have lapsed. After 10,000 generations of inheritance, there must be around three million &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo; or mutations. It being accumulated about three million in one cell. The ratio is around 0.5 (3 million &divide; 6,000 million) which is exactly the difference between Michelle and mitochondrial Eve.
