The &quot;out of <st1:place w:st="on">Africa</st1:place> origin&quot;&nbsp;lacks the critical fossil evidence. For a long period of time, scientists have not found any fossil remains of modern man in <st1:place w:st="on">Africa</st1:place> during this critical stage in the origin of modern man which dated back to between 100,000 to 300,000 years ago. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>When the <span class="SpellE">Herto</span> skulls were unearthed in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ethiopia</st1:place></st1:country-region> in 1997, was there fossil evidence dated back to 160,000 years ago.

Undoubtedly, these provided new evidence for the &quot;out of <st1:place w:st="on">Africa</st1:place> origin&quot;. Evidence from fossils and DNA decoding confirm the common belief of most anthropologists: modern man originated from the eastern part of <st1:place w:st="on">Africa</st1:place> about 200,000 to 250,000 years ago. We can say that <span class="SpellE">Omo</span> man is the ancestor of all modern man on earth. Scientists reconstructed a model of <span class="SpellE">Omo&#39;s</span> face by using the skull bone <span class="GramE">fossil(</span> Figure 5-4).<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hps"><span>The technology of reconstruction of facial feature is quite mature thanks to the technical support from modern forensic science, anthropology and computer 3-D techniques. The current method to reconstruct the facial features from clay is start building a plaster model from the skull bones. Then, drill many holes on the plaster model according to anatomical parameters. Next, insert a piece of wood into each hole. The outward protruding length of the wood is equal to the thickness of the soft tissue. The eye socket is then filled with a plastic eyeball. Layers of clay form the facial muscles until all the wooden pieces are covered. Finally, facial features are added with finishing touches on the overall model. To validate this technique, experts in this field don&#39;t have to look at the original photo of the person in question. After reconstruction of this person&#39;s face with the plaster model, he/she then compares this person&#39;s photo with the model. Skilled experts can reconstruct a model which very closely resembles the actual face of the person. Therefore, <span class="SpellE">Omo</span> man&iexcl;&macr;s reconstructed model created by these experts must be quite reliable.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>From the figure we can see that his outward appearance is not that difference from us. We can say that his skin color is a mixture of all the skin colors from peoples all over the world. The experts which created the model must have their reason for this skin color. People who live in areas where there is extreme intense sunlight must have darker skin. However, those who live in area without much sun have lighter skin color. Some descendants of ancestors who had lived in areas with intense sunlight for over 200,000 years invariably must have very dark skin as is the case of Africans. Other descendants of the same ancestors who had migrated to areas with less intense sunlight and lived there for </span><span class="hps"><span lang="EN">tens of thousands</span></span><span> of years will have lighter skin color as is the case with the Europeans and Asians.

These necklaces could be what ladies wore as decoration at that time. Relics and items for this period we can deduce that their culture had made great progress. These excavated remains are the earliest fossils from those ancient modern men outside of <st1:place w:st="on">Africa</st1:place>. They must be the first immigrants who left <st1:place w:st="on">Africa</st1:place>. <o:p></o:p></span></h3><h3><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></h3><h3><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></h3><p><span><img alt="Image" border="0" height="428" src="image58.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1032" width="612" /></span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p><p><b><span>Figure 5-8 Human beaded necklaces made from shells 100,000 years ago<o:p></o:p></span></b></p><p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p><span>However, in this and surrounding regions, no one has found evidence of the ancient life in period of the tens of thousands after 100,000 years. Their descendants have disappeared. How did they get here? Where did their descendant go? To resolve this mystery, archeologists started logical analysis of the natural and geological environment 100,000 years ago.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p><span>As we have mentioned earlier, the discovery of the ancient <span class="SpellE">Herto</span> fossils from 160,000 years ago is sufficient evidence that they are our ancestors from the Great Rift Valley, the place of origin, to the northern part of <st1:place w:st="on">Africa</st1:place>. However, in the next 30,000 years, they could not migrate to more distant places because on their east is the ocean and the north, the <st1:placename w:st="on">Sahara</st1:placename><st1:placetype w:st="on">Desert</st1:placetype>.

Within a few thousand years, the desert became an oasis filled with birds and animals, a picture of life. This dramatic change in climate brought many opportunities to the inhabitants. They must have gradually moved closer to the northern part of the continent with such livable conditions. After thousands, even tens of thousands of years, and many generations, finally, they left the African continent and entered Asia and reached modern day <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region> where they settled and reproduced (Reference 4).<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span class="hps"><span>However, after 20,000 to 30,000 years, the climate had undergone another change. This time, it brought bad luck to the descendants of the original immigrants. This climate change ushered in a period of drought and desert-like condition to <st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region> and the northwest region in Asia and the <st1:place w:st="on">North Africa</st1:place> region. When faced with less and less rainfall, dry grass, and animals dying off, these ancient people had no way to go or retreat from. The once thriving immigrant communities eventually faced complete extinction.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p><div><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><b><span>1</span></b><b><span><a href="ENT5-P2.html">2</a><a href="ENT5-P3.html">3</a><a href="ENT5-P4.html">4</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><a href="ENT5-P2.html"><span>Next Page</span></a><span>&nbsp; </span></span></b><b><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="indexEN.html">Back to Homepage</a></span></b></p></div></div></div></tbody></section></div><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p></o:p></span></p></div></div></tbody></section></div><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p></div></body></html></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="container"><div class="footer-content"><div><h4>DNA Decoding Science Alliance</h4><p>Exploring the origins of species through DNA analysis and molecular anthropology.</p></div><div><h4>Quick Links</h4><ul style="list-style: none;"><li><a href="/content/english/" style="color: white;">English Content</a></li><li><a href="/content/chinese/" style="color: white;">中文内容</a></li><li><a href="/books/" style="color: white;">Publications</a></li><li><a href="/research/" style="color: white;">Research</a></li></ul></div><div><h4>Contact</h4><p>For inquiries about DNA decoding research and publications.</p><p>© 2024 DNA Decoding Science Alliance.
