Who was Thomas Jefferson&#39;s illegitimate son?</span></b><span><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826) was one of the leaders in the American War of Independence. He helped drafted the Declaration of Independence. He served as the first U.S. Secretary of State, the second Vice President and the third President. Together with Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt, he is considered one of the four greatest presidents in American history. Despite all his world <span class="GramE">renown</span> accomplishments, he was a controversial person. For over one hundred years, rumors about his love affair with his black slave and having illegitimate children generated a great deal of heated debates and controversy. At last, this mystery in American history was resolved by Y chromosome DNA decoding. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><st1:place w:st="on"><span>Jefferson&#39;</span></st1:place><span>s wife, Martha, was a beautiful white woman. Unfortunately, after Martha Jefferson gave birth to their youngest daughter, Molly, she died in 1782. At her deathbed, she begged her husband never get married again. With tears in his eyes, the 39 year old <st1:place w:st="on">Jefferson</st1:place> agreed. <st1:place w:st="on">Jefferson</st1:place> kept this promise and never had another wedding in his life. Five years after the death of his wife, Jefferson was appointed as the <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region> ambassador to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">France</st1:place></st1:country-region>. The 19 year old Sally (1773-1835), Martha&#39;s half sister, went with him to <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Paris</st1:place></st1:city> to take care of him. Sally&#39;s grandmother was a black slave who gave birth to Sally&#39;s mother with her white master. According to the prevailing law, Sally&#39;s mother was still a black </span><span class="hps"><span lang="EN">slave</span></span><span>. Sally&#39;s mother and <st1:place w:st="on">Jefferson&#39;</st1:place>s father-in-law or his wife Martha&#39;s father was Sally&#39;s parents. Even though Sally, a beautiful girl with only had one quarter Negro blood, however, in accordance with the prevailing law, she was still a slave depraved of any freedom. Therefore, she did not have the title as his wife even though she lived with <st1:place w:st="on">Jefferson</st1:place> for 30 years.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Sally gave birth to four children. In view of her position as a humble slave, people did pay much attention to her children. Her eldest son, Woodson Was born in 1790 and the youngest son <span class="SpellE">Eston</span> In 1808.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eston</span> had one eighth Negro blood in him but he looked very much like <st1:place w:st="on">Jefferson</st1:place>. Moreover, he had political talent which eventually landed him in political circle in <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Wisconsin</st1:place></st1:state>. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>However, now President Jefferson never admitted to having these children with Sally to protect his own political reputation.<span>&nbsp; </span>For a period of time, this matter often became a political bargaining chip and later became an inheritance lawsuit. For the last hundred years, this matter has been an unraveled mystery.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hps"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hps"><span>In 1997, there was a turning point in this historical mystery. Dr. </span></span><span class="mw-headline"><span>Eugene A. Foster</span></span><span class="hps"><span>, a famous professor of pathology proposed the <span class="GramE">a</span> plan to search with the Y chromosome&nbsp;in order to unravel the mystery surround the blood linkage in <st1:place w:st="on">Jefferson&#39;</st1:place>s children. At that time, the confirmation of father-son relationship with Y chromosome testing was already well established. Moreover, the mitochondrial Eve hypothesis was established as well. It so happened that in this same year the Y chromosome Adam hypothesis was first proposed. Theoretically and technologically, the time was ripe for Professor Foster&#39;s plan to be actualized.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p class="ListParagraph"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst"><b><span>2. The Y chromosome analysis finally unraveled the mystery surrounding <st1:place w:st="on">Jefferson&#39;</st1:place>s illegitimate children.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>The simplest way to solve the mystery surrounding Jefferson&#39;s illegitimate children is to compare the Y chromosome from the remains of <st1:place w:st="on">Jefferson</st1:place> and the self proclaimed descendants of his. However, it is almost an impossible task to reopen the coffin and do autopsy on the past president. The only feasible way was to use what the Y chromosome theory proposed, namely to use DNA from modern humans to search for the ancestors of president Jefferson. This method requires the comparison of the Y chromosome from <st1:place w:st="on">Jefferson&#39;</st1:place>s descendants with those of the descendants from the illegitimate children. If results found to be similar, then, the possibility exists that they were <st1:place w:st="on">Jefferson&#39;</st1:place>s descendants. If dissimilar, then the &quot;suspected descendants&quot;&nbsp;were not <st1:place w:st="on">Jefferson&#39;</st1:place>s descendants. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>It is unfortunate, <st1:place w:st="on">Jefferson&#39;</st1:place>s only son died at age 9. Therefore, there are no descendants. Fortunately, President Thomas Jefferson had an uncle named Field.<span>&nbsp; </span>He had many descendants. After much effort, Professor Foster finally contacted the fifth generation of <st1:place w:st="on">Jefferson</st1:place>&iexcl;&macr;s uncle and collected their blood samples. At the same time, Professor Foster successfully collected blood samples from the descendants of slave <span class="GramE">Sally&#39;s <span>&nbsp;</span>eldest</span> son Woodson And youngest son <span class="SpellE">Eston</span>. Together with collective effort from several molecular biologists, the confirmation was eventually a success. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>In the November 1998 issue of Nature, the DNA analysis was published (<span class="hps">Reference <span class="GramE">3 )</span></span>. A summary of this report with explanation is shown in the Figure below. From this Figure, one can see that on the 11 STR loci, <span class="SpellE">Eston&#39;s</span> descendants STR and the STR from five <st1:place w:st="on">Jefferson&#39;</st1:place>s descendants were similar. With question, <span class="SpellE">Eston</span> had inherited the Y chromosome from <st1:place w:st="on">Jefferson&#39;</st1:place>s family. However, a contrary conclusion was reached with Sally&#39;s eldest son, Woodson. <o:p></o:p><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="hps"><span><img alt="" src="/ENT3-P2_files/4-4.jpg" />Figure 3-4 DNA confirmation of father-son relationship of Jefferson and <span class="SpellE">Eston</span></span></span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>In 2001, the independent committee commissioned by the Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society issued a 565-page report saying that <span class="SpellE">Eston</span> may be the son of Thomas Jefferson&#39;s brother Randolph Jefferson. The DNA evidence is simply too cruel. It is no way to deny that <span class="SpellE">Eston</span> was part of the <st1:place w:st="on">Jefferson&#39;</st1:place>s family. This independent committee was too clever for they knew that the Y chromosome must be the same between these two brothers. There is no way to prove or disprove the &quot;brother&#39;s son&quot;&nbsp;claim. Obviously, this also points out the limitation of tracing ones genealogy with the Y chromosome.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>We will not further dig into the aforementioned controversy as to who is right and who is wrong.
