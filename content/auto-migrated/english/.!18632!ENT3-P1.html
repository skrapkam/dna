In 1917, Nicholas II was forced to abdicate his throne during the turbulent Russian revolution. It was said that to thoroughly <span class="GramE">crushed</span> the desire of the royalists to restore their former glories, Bolshevik leader Lenin gave the order to execute the tsar and his family.<span>&nbsp; </span>The executioner, Yekaterinburg, received this order on July 17, 1918 at 1 a.m. The imprisoned tsar, including his family and their four attendants were immediately wakened. The tsar family included Tsar Nicholas II, Empress Alexandra and their four daughters: 23 year old Olga, 21 year old Tatiana, 19 year old Maria and 17 year old Anastasia and 14 year old son Alexei. The four attendants were Dr. Eugene <span class="SpellE">Botkin</span>, male servant Alexei <span class="SpellE">Trupp</span> and female servant Anna <span class="SpellE">Memidova</span> and the cook Ivan <span class="SpellE">Kharitonov</span>.

Then the leader of execution squad approached the Tsar and took a piece of paper out of his pocket with one hand while his other rested on a revolver inside his jacket. Hastily he read the notice which condemned them to death. The Tsar was confused. He turned to his family, <span class="GramE">then</span> to the guards, who drew their weapons. The girls started to scream. The firing began. First to be hit was Tsar; he slumped to the floor. The cellar echoed with the screams as they ricocheted around the room. It was pandemonium, and the room soon filled with smoke, making it even hard for the squad to pick out their <span class="GramE">target who were</span> rushing to and fro in a blind panic.

Hence, with the bodies burnt and their faces disfigured with sulfuric acid, they were hastily buried in a swallow hole. With the passage of time, the whereabouts of the Tsar and his family became a mystery. The Bolshevik Red government merely announced that the Tsar had been executed and failed to mention what had happen to his family or attendants.
