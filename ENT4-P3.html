						<p ><span >.&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p ><span >Who were the ancestors of the Europeans? There is, in fact, already an answer to this question. The answer came from the analyses of DNA samples collected from the millions of Europeans and European immigrants who lived in North America. Their patrilineal ancestor was a male with the M168 genetic marker and their matrilineal ancestor was a woman with the L3 genetic marker. They were all, without exception, descendants of Y chromosome Adam and Mitochondrial Eve.&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p ><span >.<br />
						Then, who were the descendants of the ancient peoples or Australopithecus? How did they live? Who was Otzi the Iceman? Were the Cro-Magnon people ancestors of the Europeans? Were the Neanderthal ancestors of Europeans? Fortunately, by using DNA decoding, we could get a clear cut answer to all these questions..</span></p>

						<p ><span >.<br />
						<strong>I. Was Otzi the Iceman an extinct race?</strong></span></p>

						<p ><span >.<br />
						Some reports claim that Otzi the Iceman is an extinct race. This, however, is a big misunderstanding. &nbsp;</span></p>

						<p  ><b ><span >&nbsp;</span></b></p>

						<p ><span >Figure 4-11 is based on the data presented in this article (Reference 7) to create the mitochondrial DNA comparison map. From this map one can see that the mitochondrial DNA of the Cro-Magnon man and the Cambridge sequence is exceedingly similar. In the mitochondrial hyper-variable region HVR1, there are only a difference of 8 mutation loci among 330 loci (from 16037 to 16366). This minor difference is the same as the DNA sequence difference between modern man and the Cambridge sequence.</span></p>

						<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p ><span >Also from this map one can see the distinct difference between the mitochondrial DNA mutations in the researchers and the mutations from samples of the Cro-Magnon man thereby confirming that these samples were not contaminated by the DNA from modern man.</span></p>

						<p  ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p  ><span >The conclusion from this article is as follows:</span></p>

						<p  ><span ><span >&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Conclusions/Significance: The Paglicci 23 individual carried a mtDNA sequence that is still common in <st1:place >Europe</st1:place>, and which radically differs from those of the almost contemporary Neandertals, demonstrating a genealogical continuity across 28,000 years, from Cro-Magnoid to modern Europeans.&rdquo; (Reference 7) </span></p>

						<p  ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p ><span class="hps"><span >A problem which had bothered archaeologist for centuries was finally and so easily solved. For this example we can see that DNA decoding is the most powerful weapons in archaeological research.</span></span><b ></b></p>
