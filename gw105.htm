GoodWatcher, a new product for the nursing homes.<BR><BR>
How do you see your loved one when they are in a nursing home?<BR><BR> 
No matter how great the nursing home is, as a relative you will 
still want to be able to know everything that goes on in the 
nursing home and be able to check in on your loved one at any 
time. In today's Internet world, having this is possible. All you 
need to do is to get GoodWatcher.<BR><BR>
GoodWatcher software is designed specifically for the nursing homes 
and allows relatives to view their loved one from anywhere at anytime.
Also it can be used in the house for viewing the elderly people by family 
members who are not able to be in the same city. <BR><BR>
It requires nothing more than a regular computer and a camera. The 
regular DSL or cable Internet speeds are enough to show clear images. <BR><BR>
-With GoodWatcher, relatives will never worry about their loved 
ones while in the nursing home again.<BR>
-With GoodWatcher relatives can be guaranteed better quality 
nursing care.<BR>
-With GoodWatcher, your loved one's safety and health will be 
better protected. It will also let the caregiver be more alert.<BR>
-It is also for the benefit of the nursing home. <BR><BR>
At present, there are many software products that provide
surveillance function which the video / pictures to be broadcasted 
by the computer of the home site and to be watched by the 
computer of remote client sites through the Internet. <BR><BR>
However, the video quality is usually poor for this kind of products 
due to network speed limitations. Especially when the server
sites (home sites) that upload the images uses DSL or regular Cable 
connection. Under these situations, regular software products often 
fail to function properly.<BR><BR>
The unique approach used in GoodWatcher enables it to work well 
under different network speeds and the image quality is always very
good. In addition, the images are stored automatically in the 
computer of both nursing home site and the client sites. The record
data will be kept up to 12 days and up to 60,000 images.ï¿½ Every 
image will contain the time stamp for searching capability for 
viewing at convenient times for necessary use.<BR><BR>
 Besides being user friendly, it also provides many additional 
features such as Alarm with calling notifications and sending 
captured images to email boxes, snap images. Moreover if there 
is no any signal from the camera (such as the wire was broken) 
for more than 5 minutes it will call notifications and send
captured images to email boxes too.<BR><BR>
