<BR>
At present, there are many software products that provide surveillance 
function which the video/pictures to be broadcasted by the computer 
of the home site and to be watched by the computer of remote client 
sites through Internet. <BR>
However, the video quality is usually poor for this kind of products due
to network speed limitations. Especially when the server sites (Home 
sites) that upload the images use DSL connection, and the client sites 
that download the images use a low speed network (such as 56 kbps/
sec.) Under these situations, regular software products often fail to 
function properly. <BR>
The unique approach used in GoodWatcher-105 enables it to work well 
under different network speeds. It can adjust the refresh rate of picture 
automatically according to the speed of the network and the image 
quality is always very good. In addition, the images are stored automatically 
in the computer of client sites for viewing at convinent times. Be
sides being user friendly, it also provides many additional features such 
as Alarm with calling notifications and/or sending captured images to 
email boxes, the capability to remotely Arm/Disarm, or snap images.
