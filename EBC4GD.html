			<p  style="text-align: justify;"><br />
			<span ><span ><span lang="ZH-CN">Textbooks have long taught us that human are evolved from apes. Today, a new science, Molecular Anthropology, tells us that: nearly 7 billion humans in the world share a com-mon grand, grand&hellip;father, the Y-chromosome Adam. And they also share a common grand, grand&hellip;mother, the Mitochondrial Eve. The difference of DNA coding is only one thousandth between any persons in the world. After reading this book, you will be con-vinced that human could not have been the result of Evolution;</span></span></span><br />
			<br />
			<span ><span ><span lang="ZH-CN">In 1987, Professor Allan Wilson&rsquo;s research team at the UC Berkeley proposed the &ldquo;Mito-chondrial Eve Theory&rdquo; by DNA coding that all human originated from one woman who lived about 200,000 years ago. In 1995, Drs. Dorit et. proposed the &ldquo;Adam Theory&rdquo; by DNA coding of Y-Chromosomal that all human originated from one man.</span></span></span></p>

			<p  style="text-align: justify;"><br />
			<span ><span ><span lang="ZH-CN">There are two kinds of DNA encoding in our body: chromosomal DNA and mitochondrial DNA. The chromosome consists of three types: autosome, Y chromosome and X chromo-some. The Eve Theory is founded on the mitochondrial DNA while the Adam Theory is founded on the Y chromosome. So what can we see from the autosome?</span></span></span></p>

			<p  style="text-align: justify;"><br />
			<span ><span ><span lang="ZH-CN">The simple biological fact that &ldquo;there are no differences between the autosomes of male and female&rdquo;, tells us a striking truth that is: the autosome of all men in the world must come from only one original version, and cannot be produced randomly.</span></span></span></p>

			<p  style="text-align: justify;"><br />
			<span ><span ><span lang="ZH-CN">Therefore, the authors have established a &ldquo;The only one Adam theory&rdquo; by the consistent of autosomal DNA coding of men and women. All human beings on earth came from him and the earliest female ancestor came from this male ancestor.</span></span></span></p>

			<p  style="text-align: justify;"><br />
			<span ><span ><span lang="ZH-CN">In addition, we also provide you with an answer which science cannot offer: Creationism.</span></span></span></p>
