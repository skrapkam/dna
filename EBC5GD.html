			<p style="text-align: justify;"><span ><span >The important conclusions from the human genome test of the DNA coding sequence: The autosomes are not different between men and women. These conclusions&nbsp; irrever-sibly refutes the traditional theory of evolution.</span></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><span ><span >We have raised this simple question to seven M.D./Ph.D. (including three professors) who are related biology specialty: Why autosomes are not different between men and women? Invariably, their answer was either: &ldquo;Cannot explain&rdquo; or &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;.</span></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><span ><span >To me as computer engineer, the human genome is equivalent to a software package. If we are certain that the 2.9 billion codes of autosomes are not different between men and women, then the autosomes must be from the same &quot;source sequence of coding&quot;.&nbsp; I am sure that such a huge coding sequence must have a maker. He made the human genome.</span></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><span ><span >Now we can reach another conclusion: the first woman came from the first man by the fact that the 2.9 billion codes of autosomes are not different between men and women.</span></span></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;"><span ><span >The next conclusion is that first man never came from a woman and he must have neither the physical parents nor a regular physiological birth. This is really a key to open the origins of mankind.</span></span></p>
