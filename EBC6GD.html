			<p  style="text-align: justify;"><span ><span ><span lang="ZH-CN">However, since DNA is discovered, the result is just like paternity test, it is confirmed that the entire human&rsquo;s DNA coding sequence is consistent and the difference is only one thousandth. The theory of mathematics-probability told us that it could not be the result of spontaneous generation. Therefore, the molecular biologist put forward that people of the whole world have the common grandfather- Y chromosome Adam theory; and the common grandmother-Eve theory. Do you agree?</span></span></span></p>

			<p  style="text-align: justify;"><br />
			<span ><span ><span lang="ZH-CN">What is amazing is that there is no difference between men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s 2.9 billion chromosomal DNA coding sequence, meaning that human DNA coding is from the only source individual. Only men have the complete set of the chromosome, so the source individual must be a man and the first woman is from the man. The first man had no carnal parents and it only could be Adam created by God. </span></span></span></p>

			<p >.</p>

			<p ><span ><span ><span lang="ZH-CN">Due to the constancy of biological genome DNA coding, it is impossible for any species to have evolution connection, not even microevolution. This is what is recorded in the Bible as &ldquo;all living from each category&rdquo;. It therefore can be seen that life&rsquo;s DNA coding sequence is from God&rsquo;s Creation.</span></span></span></p>

			<p  style="text-align: justify;"><br />
			<span ><span ><span lang="ZH-CN">From our DNA, we could see that all the substances and lives in the universe are created by God. These scientific facts are totally consistent with the Biblical record and are objective evidence of the Christian faith.</span></span></span></p>
