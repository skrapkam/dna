						<span lang="EN" >Before discussing the European and Asian ancestors, it is necessary to introduce some methodologies adopted by modern anthropology to determine dates.</span></p>

						<p ><span class="hps"><span ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><b ></b></p>

						<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p ><span >In previous part, we discussed the Y chromosome Adam theory as well as the Mitochondrial Eve theory. Based on these theories one can extend the millennium quest with the use of DNA from modern man to trace his ancestors in the distant past. The principle behind this type of tracing and confirmation of paternal relationship is quite similar. From the standpoint of hereditary lineage, it is both accurate and error free.<span >&nbsp; </span>However, since DNA mutation is random and the mutation rate is inconstant, it is inaccurate way to determine the year of birth of our ancestors regardless of the way one uses to trace <span class="SpellE">geneology</span> i.e. via mitochondrial DNA or the Y chromosome. To get an accurate time period one needs to rely on anthropological dating techniques. </span></p>

						<p ><span class="hps"><span >In the dating of some archeological articles, often two dates are given: one being the carbon 14 (C14 years before <span class="GramE">present &rdquo;</span> C14 BP&rdquo;), and the other being the calendar years (Calendar years before the present, &rdquo;Cal BP&rdquo; or BP ). For example, if the age of the charred wood discovered in a cave is determined to be 12,500 (C14 BP ) and 14,5000 (Cal BP), the former is the result of carbon 14 dating and the latter is the corrected calendar years. </span></span></p>

						<p ><span class="hps"><b ><span >&nbsp;</span></b></span></p>

						<p ><span class="hps"><b ><span >Some people don&rsquo;t consider the carbon 14 method to be reliable. They believe that our earth and mankind only has a 10,000 year history. However, it is not consistent with scientific facts.</span></b></span></p>

						<p ><span class="hps"><b ><span >2.</span></b></span><span class="shorttext"><b ></b></span><span class="hps"><b ><span >The other</span></b></span><span class="shorttext"><b ></b></span><span class="hps"><b ><span >dating methods</span></b></span></p>

						<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p class="ListParagraph" ><span >(1)Uranium dating method</span></p>

						<p  ><span >One of the isotopic dating methods is based on the ratio of radioactive uranium nuclides to determine the age of the geological sediments. Commonly used date methods use uranium 234U/238U, thorium-<span class="GramE">uranium<span >&nbsp; </span>230Th</span>/234U<sup> </sup>and thorium-lead 231Th/210Pb.</span></p>

						<p class="ListParagraph" ><span >The principle of measurement is 238U and 235U decay series contain a variety of radioisotopes. In the normal geological processes, </span><span class="hps"><span lang="EN" >Daughter</span></span><span >of uranium such as thorium, and lead separate themselves from parent uranium-238U and 235U. And each half-life will determine their respective rate of decay. The body of the mother forms the decay of the daughter nuclides. Radiation detectors can be used to measure the radioactive isotopes ratios in order to calculate the age of the geological sediment. If ancient mankind&rsquo;s remains and relics in these sediments with the same age as the sediment, then this will represent the times when the ancient people had lived. </span></p>

						<p  ><span >This method is suitable for dating the Paleolithic ancient ruins around 50,000 -600,000 years ago. Moreover, this method is limited to the determination of calcium carbonate rich rocks.</span></p>

						<p ><span ><span >&nbsp;</span>(2)Potassium-Argon Dating Method</span></p>

						<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p ><span >Another isotopic dating method is to use potassium 40 which is an unstable isotope. It can decay and become argon 40. Within a stone, argon is in a liquid form and can freely escape. After the stone solidifies, potassium 40 decays to become argon 40 remaining in the stone. Using mass spectrometry instrument one can measure the argon 40 and the remaining potassium 40 ratio. From this ratio one can calculate the age of the mineral crystal and the rock containing potassium. Moreover, one can determine the age by which the rock was formed. The half-life of potassium 40 is 1.25 billion years and thus can be used to determine rocks which were formed over 100,000 years ago. More recently formed rock does not meeting the desired dating accuracy because the argon content is too low. This method is often used to determine geological events in active volcano areas.</span></p>

						<p ><span ><span >&nbsp;</span>(3)<span class="SpellE">Thermoluminesense</span> (TL) and Optically Stimulated <span class="SpellE">Luminesence</span> (OSL) Dating Methods</span></p>

						<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p ><span class="SpellE"><span >Thermoluminesense</span></span><span > (TL) Dating method: Quartz crystals in feldspar, calcite, pottery, porcelain and other objects contain lattice crystal structures which can absorb radioactive electrons trapped in the lattice at a fixed rate over time.<span >&nbsp; </span>The energy in these trapped electrons can be released producing a range of luminescent glows shown as light by heating with just a small sample from the aforementioned objects.</span></p>

						<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p ><span >The amount of energy can be measured by the <span class="SpellE">thermoluminescence</span> detection instrument. After subjecting to heating, certain types of electron trapping mechanism become zero. The measured amount of radiation energy is directly proportional to the age of the ceramic.</span></p>

						<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p ><span >This is the principle behind the <span class="SpellE">thermoluminescence</span> as a dating method. The TL method dating range varies from several hundred years to one </span><span class="hps"><span lang="EN" >Millions</span></span><span >years. Its major use is in dating burnt or heated objects. It is widely used in determining the date of archeological <span class="GramE">objects<span >&nbsp; </span>and</span> antique such as pottery, porcelain, burnt soil in addition, flint, sedimentary soils.</span></p>

						<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p ><span >Optically Stimulated Luminescence Dating</span></p>

						<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p ><span >In recent years, Optically Stimulated Luminescence Dating, abbreviated OSL, was developed based on the principle from the TL dating method. Instead of heat, OSL uses an argon ion laser or xenon lamp to excite the stored energy. A more accurate date can be obtained if one compares the results from OSL and TL methods.</span></p>
