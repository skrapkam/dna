						<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
						<span ><span >Objectively speaking, over one hundred years since its birth, the Theory of Evolution has experienced numerous debates and succeeded every time in beating its challengers. Therefore, the Theory of Evolution is considered as irrefutable truth in biological science circles. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
						<span ><span >People can&rsquo;t help asking this question: what evidence do you have to overthrow the Theory of Evolution?&nbsp;<br />
						Our answer is that our evidence is based on just two simple weapons, i.e. DNA codes and secondary school mathematics. DNA codes come from GenBank (NBIC GenBank, the U.S.); mathematics provides Exponential operation, logarithm operation and Dice Theory.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
						<span ><span >For human beings, the DNA codes carry all genetic information of human beings. It is the physical genetic information carried by these DNA codes that determine the human body and the physiological features; whereas the non-physical genetic information manifests mankind&rsquo;s intelligence and other related features. The facts revealed by the DNA codes are diametrically opposite to the Theory of Evolution. Meanwhile, mathematics is a powerful weapon of DNA decoding because mathematics can most profoundly show which one is the improbable hypothesis and which one is the inevitable fact.</span></span></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
						<span ><span >&nbsp;&ldquo;Neither is it the framer of theories, for it is not hypothesis; but it is the judge over both, and it is the arbiter to which each must refer its claims; and neither law can rule nor theory explain without the sanction of mathematics.&rdquo; (Benjamin Peirce, 1809 &ndash; 1880, the U.S. mathematician and astronomer)&nbsp;</span></span></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
						<span ><span >Therefore, &ldquo;Mathematics is the Queen of the Sciences&rdquo;. (Carl Friedrich Gauss, 1777-1855, the German physicist and astronomer).</span></span></p>
