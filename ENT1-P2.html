						<p ><strong><span lang="EN" >3. Some Inherent markers in human DNA codes &nbsp;</span></strong></p>

						<p ><br />
						<span lang="EN" >In fact, in human DNA sequences there exist many long DNA sequence markers composed of hundreds and even thousands of DNA nucleotides. These long sequences exist in the chromosomes of every human being, which were &nbsp;not formed by mutation but were inherent in human beings when they first appeared on earth. For example, the ZFY gene of man&rsquo;s Y chromosome has 729 completely identical DNA coding sequences, which constitute a single &nbsp;&ldquo;inherent marker.&rdquo; Such inherent markers cannot be generated by DNA mutation during human breeding but inherently present in every human beings.&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p ><br />
						<span lang="EN" >As something which occurs at random, mutation cannot generate completely the same 729 DNA coding sequences in all men. Even the autosomes have &ldquo;inherent markers&rdquo; existing in all men and women. The inherent markers do not function to recognize the different races but allows scientists to search for the origin of mankind.&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p ><br />
						<span lang="EN" >The focus of Molecular anthropology research is on genetic markers in DNA, containing &ldquo;mutation markers&rdquo; and &ldquo;inherent markers&rdquo; for scientists to trace the origin, distribution of human beings as well serve as official records of human historical archives.&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p ><br />
						<span lang="EN" >Other species &nbsp;also have the aforementioned &nbsp;&ldquo;mutation markers&rdquo; and &ldquo;inherent markers&rdquo;. These DNA genetic markers are the most authoritative and most accurate evidence of the origin, categorization and migration for &nbsp;all living &nbsp;species.&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p ><br />
						<span lang="EN" ><strong>4. NCBI-GenBank DNA repository of all living beings</strong></span></p>

						<p ><br />
						<span lang="EN" >The GenBank of the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) is the largest data bank of biological DNA in the world. For over 30 years, this information bank with millions of biological DNA coding sequences&ndash;was &nbsp;formed by the collective &nbsp;efforts of millions of scientific researchers. These coding sequences come from laboratories worldwide, containing genetic information on human beings and other tens of thousands of non-human species.&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p ><br />
						<span lang="EN" >Researchers from every corner &nbsp;of the world can directly submit their respective biological DNA sequences to GenBank. However, rather than &nbsp;immediate publication, the data has &nbsp;to be &nbsp;compared and verified &nbsp;by a group of experts at GenBank before publication to ensure reliability of the data.&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p ><br />
						<span lang="EN" >Meanwhile, everyone on earth has the ability to directly access all DNA data at &nbsp;GenBank. This &nbsp;database has significantly accelerated our understanding of the mystery of human beings and other related species. Moreover, it started the DNA decoding era of anthropological and other biological research which will be covered &nbsp;in upcoming chapters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p  ><b ><span >5. Development of Molecular <span class="SpellE">Antrhopology</span></span></b></p>

						<p  ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p  ><span >The development of molecular anthropology has been very difficult. Why are there so few people going into the field of molecular anthropology? It is considered a &ldquo;cold field&rdquo; in research primarily because the dearth of derive economic benefits from studying this discipline. When compared to the &ldquo;hot field&rdquo; in research, there is a vast difference in terms of research funding. Also, there are very few colleges or universities which offer this course.</span></p>

						<p  ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p  ><span >Nevertheless, in the past 20 years, the team of molecular anthropologists is gradually growing stronger at many traditionally well known academic institutions and organizations. </span></p>

						<p  ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p  ><b ><span >Here is a brief introduction of some institutions.</span></b></p>

						<p  ><span class="GramE"><span >the</span></span><span > <span class="SpellE">Genographic</span> Project. Spending hundreds million of dollars in research funding, its mission is to address the following questions: Who are we? What <span class="GramE">is the origins</span> of mankind? How did we populate the earth? This project involved 11 prestigious research laboratories, universities and experts in relevant research disciplines. The head of the project was Dr. Spencer Wells, the author of &ldquo;The Journey of Man: A Genetic Odyssey&rdquo;</span></p>

						<p  ><span >In a few years&rsquo; time, they have analyzed more than 580,000 DNA samples around the world. At the present, they still collect approximately 10,000 every month. In the National Geographic Society website we can read the answer to the question concerning how <span class="GramE">mankind populate</span> our earth: &ldquo;We are all descendents from a common African ancestor who lived only 140,000 years ago.&rdquo;</span></p>

						<p ><span >Based on the theories of &ldquo;Y-chromosome Adam&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mitochondrial Eve&rdquo;, there are many organizations and companies around the world engaged in DNA <span class="SpellE">geneology</span> testing to help individuals seek their origins. <span class="SpellE">Curently</span>, there are over two million samples in the databases.</span></p>

						<p ><span >It is apparent that <span class="SpellE">molelcular</span> anthropology is founded on the theory of a large number of DNA decoding. It is absolutely credible. The <span class="GramE">conclusions in this book is</span> based on the research reports drawn from prestigious journals. Most of the material in this book is not available in the current textbooks. If <span class="GramE">these new scientific results exceeds</span> your expectation, please don&rsquo;t be alarmed. From the very beginning of the human genome research, there was an international consensus that all research results will be transparent and shared. Therefore, most of the cited references are available on the web for you to determine their authenticity.<span >&nbsp; </span></span></p>
